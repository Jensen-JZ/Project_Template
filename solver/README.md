# Solver Directory (`solver/`)

## Purpose

The `solver/` directory is dedicated to managing the core logic of the model training and evaluation processes. It orchestrates the training loop, defines and computes loss functions, handles optimization procedures, implements learning rate scheduling, and includes any other utilities directly related to the "solving" or training of models. The main goal is to encapsulate the training mechanics, making them configurable and separable from model definitions and data loading.

## Current Structure & File Descriptions

This directory currently contains the following Python modules:

*   **`solver.py`**:
    *   **Description**: This is the heart of the training process. It contains the main training class or functions that manage the overall training and evaluation loops. This includes iterating over data, performing forward and backward passes, updating model parameters, invoking schedulers, and logging training progress.
*   **`loss.py`**:
    *   **Description**: Contains definitions for various loss functions used during model training. This might include standard losses (e.g., CrossEntropyLoss, MSELoss) or custom-designed losses tailored to specific tasks (e.g., contrastive losses like CLIPLoss, or specialized geo-localization losses).
*   **`misc.py`**:
    *   **Description**: A collection of miscellaneous utility functions and classes that are specifically helpful for the solver and the training/evaluation process. This could include things like custom learning rate schedulers, early stopping mechanisms, or specific logging helpers not covered by `utils/logger.py`.
*   **`utils.py`**:
    *   **Description**: Provides other general utility functions that support the operations within `solver.py` and other modules in this directory. This might include functions for moving data to devices, simple metric calculations used during training steps, or other helper functionalities that are closely tied to the solver's operations but are not part of the main loop or loss computation.

## Component Interactions

The components within the `solver/` directory work closely together:

1.  **`solver.py` (Main Orchestrator)**:
    *   Initializes the model, optimizer, and learning rate scheduler.
    *   Iterates through data provided by `DataLoader` instances (defined in `data/loader.py` and using `data/dataset.py`).
    *   For each batch, it performs the forward pass through the model.
    *   It then utilizes functions or classes from **`loss.py`** to compute the loss between the model's predictions and the ground truth labels.
    *   The computed loss is used to perform the backward pass and update model weights via the optimizer.
    *   It may call utility functions from **`misc.py`** or **`utils.py`** for tasks like logging intermediate results, adjusting learning rates based on custom schedules, or checking for early stopping conditions.
    *   During evaluation phases, it will use the model to make predictions and may again use **`loss.py`** for validation loss or functions from `metrics/` (if available) for detailed performance evaluation.

2.  **`loss.py`**:
    *   Provides the loss computation logic called by `solver.py`. It takes model outputs and ground truth data as input.

3.  **`misc.py` and `utils.py`**:
    *   Offer supporting functions that are imported and used by `solver.py` or even `loss.py` as needed to streamline operations and keep the main `solver.py` code focused.

## Customizing the Training Process

To customize or extend the training process:

1.  **Modify Loss Functions**:
    *   To use a different loss function, you can define it in `loss.py` and then modify `solver.py` to instantiate and use your new loss.
    *   Ensure the new loss function is compatible with the model's output and the available ground truth data.

2.  **Change Optimizer or Learning Rate Scheduler**:
    *   `solver.py` is where the optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD) and LR scheduler (e.g., StepLR, ReduceLROnPlateau) are typically initialized. You can change these by modifying their instantiation in `solver.py`.
    *   For custom LR schedulers not available in PyTorch, you might define them in `misc.py` and then use them in `solver.py`.

3.  **Adjust Training Loop Logic**:
    *   The core training loop (forward pass, loss computation, backward pass, optimizer step) is in `solver.py`. Modifications to this sequence, or adding custom actions per step/epoch, should be done here.
    *   For example, to implement gradient accumulation, you would modify the backward pass and optimizer step logic within the loop in `solver.py`.

4.  **Add Custom Callbacks or Hooks**:
    *   If you need to perform specific actions at different stages of training (e.g., end of epoch, start of training), you can add callback functions. These could be defined in `misc.py` or directly in `solver.py` and called at appropriate points in the training loop.

5.  **New Utilities**:
    *   If your customization requires new helper functions, add them to `misc.py` or `utils.py` depending on their specificity and scope.

6.  **Configuration**:
    *   Ideally, many aspects of the solver (learning rate, optimizer type, loss parameters) should be configurable via command-line arguments or a configuration file, which would be parsed by the main script that calls the solver (e.g., a script in `scripts/`). Ensure `solver.py` can accept these configurations.

When making changes, especially to `solver.py`, ensure that logging and checkpointing mechanisms correctly reflect any new parameters or states you introduce.
